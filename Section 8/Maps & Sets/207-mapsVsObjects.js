// NOTE:

// Maps:
// 1) Can use ANY values(and types) as keys
// 2) Better performance for large quantities of data
// 3) Better performance when adding or removing data frequently

// Objects:
// 1) Only may use: strings, numbers or symbols as keys
// 2) Perfect for small/medium-sized sets of data
// 3) Easier/quicker to create (typically also with better performance)
